        {"I'm currently working as a contractor in the financial services sector, with specific experience investigating third party complaints for online retailers. However, a passion for technology and creative problem solving led me to enroll on Manchester Codes' Software Development Bootcamp in January. I'm revelling in the challenge of becoming a full-stack web developer, and I'm hoping to secure a role where I can utilise my experience working with clients and stakeholders, and continue to develop my programming skills.".toUpperCase()}
